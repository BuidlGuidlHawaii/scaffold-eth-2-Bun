## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Bun (>= v1.2.4)](https://bun.sh)
- [Node (>= v20.18.3)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (required for some dependencies)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

To get started with Scaffold-ETH 2 (Bun Edition), follow the steps below:

1. Clone this repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/scaffold-eth/scaffold-eth-2-Bun.git
cd scaffold-eth-2-Bun
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

3. Run a local network in the first terminal:

```bash
bun chain
```

This command starts a local Ethereum network that runs on your local machine and can be used for testing and development. Learn how to [customize your network configuration](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/quick-start/environment#1-initialize-a-local-blockchain).

4. On a second terminal, deploy the test contract:

```bash
bun run deploy
```

This command deploys a test smart contract to the local network. You can find more information about how to customize your contract and deployment script in our [documentation](https://docs.scaffoldeth.io/quick-start/environment#2-deploy-your-smart-contract).

5. On a third terminal, start your NextJS app:

```bash
bun start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`. You can interact with your smart contract using the `Debug Contracts` page. You can tweak the app config in `packages/nextjs/scaffold.config.ts`.
